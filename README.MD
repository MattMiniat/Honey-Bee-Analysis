# What is All the Buzz About Bees?
Honey Bees are a crucial part of the agriculture sector in any community...

> **USGS**: According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), bees of all sorts pollinate approximately 75 percent of the fruits, nuts and vegetables grown in the United States, and one out of every four bites of food people take is courtesy of bee pollination. In sum, bee pollination is responsible for more than $15 billion in increased crop value each year. [<sup>1</sup>](#1)

We used multiple data sources varying from API interactions to data provided through buggy web applications.[<sup>2</sup>](#2)

## Hypotheses
* 1. As ambient temperature decreases, bee population decreases
* 2. As the average presence of pesticides in honey samples increased; bee population decreased

## Repo Guide
/Colony_and_Pest_Dataset
Includes ColoniesPy which allows the user to pull data from USDA and request state. This request then creates a line graph outlining the colony data for bees in that state.
includes PestsPy which allows the user to pull data from USDA and request state. This request then creates a line graph outlining Varroa Mite affecting Bee colonies based on the state selected.
Images generated by above scripts are saved in the Output directory.

### /Honey_Sales_and_Production
Includes honey_production_and_sales_final which allows the user to graph production and sales for the US and Texas based on CSV pull from USDA.
Images generated by above scripts are saved in output_images directory.

### /Pesticide_Data
Includes Pesticides which graphs data based on certain pesticides found and used in honey.
Images generated by above scripts are saved in output_images directory.

### /Temperature_Bee
This is the Temperature data for Texas. This can be located in Weather_Texas.ipynb file. I took the information from api_pull.ipynb to compare bees to temperature. 
In the output_images folder, you can find the graphs that have been generated based off of Weather_Texas.ipynb. 
Please use Weather_Texas.ipynb as the main file for this section of Bee Project.
