# UTT-DataBC-Project-1

Plan A,
Identify the impact on small business due to the cancellation of SXSW.
Create survey and make it go viral to create data set. Our goal is to get 75 survey by Saturday the 14th or we will go to plan B.

Plan B,
Everyone comes with one back up plan on Saturday the 14th and we will decide an offical back up if the survey data falls through.
